Digital Public Goods Open Source Community Manager Program
# Overview

Both the DPGs and the Community Managers are invited to attend the training program.

The training program consists of group sessions and 1-on-1’s with the trainer and providing feedback during the program

Group sessions have been scheduled to accommodate the availability of the largest number of selected applicants in the Community Manager cohort.  

Participants have been selected by the DPGs and GitHub

👉 All Participants who want to attend sessions or watch the videos will have filled out the [DPGCM: Training Session Sign up & Recording Form Preferences](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe8XORO26z0GTK_EbLGQqTySZdCD4JKm1T6IDkIQkIZi7F5bw/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.715977051=Yes) form

👉 Everyone who indicated they wanted to attend the training sessions, will have been sent an invitation to [DPGCM Group Session Calendar](calendar)

👉 Community Manager’s in the cohort should [Book a 30 min 1-on-1](https://calendar.app.google/rbxVyji7PUp7GwRB9) each week at a time that is convenient for them. If the DPG staff wish to have 1-on-1 time, they may also book 1 session per DPG, per week in addition to the community manager 1-on-1.

*If there are multiple community managers per DPG they can all attend the same 1-on-1 session.

👉 We are using the [GitHub Code of Conduct](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-code-of-conduct).  If you have any questions or issues, please reach out to the Trainer or Program Manager using the [questions form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdxl6nUoPpc9qsvQH91VKXx4JCLN0os7D8nkMiNGOBpkRaGkg/viewform)

👉 Attend any of the training sessions that you are able to

👉 Trainer will send a post session email within 4 hours of the group session.  The email will contain
- Customized Attendance & Content Survey link and reminder
- Pre-read for next session
- [Dashboard link](index.md)

👉 Attend weekly 1-on-1s (if you are a DPG Community Manager, optional if you are not).

👉 If you attend any sessions with the trainer (group or 1-on-1), please fill out the Attendance and Content Survey, even if you opt not to provide any feedback.  This will avoid us sending you reminder emails.

❓ If you have questions, please fill out our [questions form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdxl6nUoPpc9qsvQH91VKXx4JCLN0os7D8nkMiNGOBpkRaGkg/viewform).  We will get back to you as soon as possible.  If the question is relevant to other cohort participants, we will anonymize and add the Q&A to the dashboard or program overview page as well.
