#### New Contributor Onboarding
Identify which contributors are already onboarded and which need onboarding
Review the new issues in the Engine or other repositories. 
- Outside contributors will create issues. These issues need to be reviewed for
  - Clarity: Do we know what the author is talking about?
  - Details: Are there enough details that a contributor, besides the author, could work on it?
  - Relevance: Is this a change that will be accepted into the code base?
  - Other?
- When responding to the author it is important to 
  - keep communication professional and friendly to encourage community engagement.
  - be familiar with the contributing guidelines so that you can make sure the Issues conform to guidelines.
- Example Issues can be found here: https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/engine/issues
